"""Exact decomposition of SPM threshold growth.

Write ``F(d, k, p)`` for the threshold estimated from the CE window of
target year ``d``, with the in-kind stage off (``k = 0``) or on
(``k = 1``), in prices of year ``p``. Growth from target year ``a`` to
``b`` of the full (in-kind) replication factors exactly as::

    F(b,1,b) / F(a,1,a) = price x real x in_kind

    price   = F(a,0,b) / F(a,0,a)        (package composite CPI)
            or I_b / I_a                 (BLS FCSUti index)
    real    = [F(b,0,b) / F(a,0,a)] / price
    in_kind = [F(b,1,b) / F(b,0,b)] / [F(a,1,a) / F(a,0,a)]

``real`` is the growth of out-of-pocket FCSUti beyond prices: new CE
data, sample composition and real spending. ``in_kind`` is the change in
the proportional lift that imputed benefits give the threshold. The
package's composite CPI rebases its weights to each window, so its price
term needs the counterfactual run ``F(a,0,b)``; BLS's index makes the
price term a scalar. Additive percentage-point contributions use the
sequential split ``(price - 1) + price (real - 1) + price real
(in_kind - 1)``, which sums to total growth exactly.
