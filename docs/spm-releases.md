# Forecast artifacts and archived releases

Version 1.0.0 uses the canonical schema-2 forecast artifact for standalone
calculations and current model adapters. Its default coverage is 2022–2035,
with `ce_trend` and `zero_real` scenarios. Published 2025 national thresholds
and BLS shelter/utilities shares remain exact inputs; modeled local rent
indices and future values carry their own statuses.

The PolicyEngine, Microcosm and Axiom integrations ship in their own
packages; `policyengine-us` 2.0 and the `policyengine` wrapper 6.0 are in
progress, and the [1.0 migration guide](migration.md) describes the
coordinated pins. The country model reads forecast configuration by default.
It does not require an opt-in historical release path or support
year/geography fallback flags.

## Schema-2 forecast contract

The default file is
[`rolling_forecast_2026_09_09.json`](../spm_calculator/data/current/rolling_forecast_2026_09_09.json).
`SPMForecast.from_dict` and `load_forecast` validate it. The archived
`data/releases/schema-v1.json` describes schema-1 releases, not this schema-2
forecast; the forecast's current validator is
[`rolling_forecast.py`](../spm_calculator/rolling_forecast.py).

| Field or path | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Integer `2`. |
| `method` | `rolling_ce_acs_v1`. |
| `units` | `USD/year`. |
| `reference_family` | `{"adults": 2, "children": 2}`. |
| `forecast_id`, `content_sha256` | Artifact identity and canonical content digest. |
| `created_on`, `information_date` | Build and retained-information dates. |
| `base_release_sha256` | Identity of the archived published input release used by assembly. |
| `sources` | List of source IDs, URLs, hashes and availability metadata. |
| `assumptions`, `assumption_sha256` | Declared assumptions and their digest. |
| `component_sha256`, `code_sha256` | Component and implementation identities. |
| `default_scenario` | Currently `ce_trend`. |
| `scenarios.<scenario>.years.<year>` | Selected-year values, statuses and window diagnostics; JSON year keys are strings. |
| `areas.<area_id>` | Area name and actual area type. |
| `county_assignments` | County vintage, boundary metadata, mapping digest, `year_maps` and `maps`. |
| `validation`, `forward_test`, `rent_sensitivity` | Evaluation and sensitivity records with their stated scope. |

Inspect these actual field names rather than constructing an incomplete
artifact by hand:

```python
from spm_calculator import load_forecast

forecast = load_forecast()
document = forecast.to_dict()
assert document["schema_version"] == 2
assert document["units"] == "USD/year"
assert document["reference_family"] == {"adults": 2, "children": 2}
entry = document["scenarios"]["ce_trend"]["years"]["2025"]
print(entry["national_status"], entry["housing_share_status"])
print(entry["thresholds"]["renter"], entry["housing_shares"]["renter"])
assignment = forecast.resolve_county(2025, "06037", county_vintage="2020")
print(entry["geography_by_area"][assignment["area_id"]])
```

Each year entry contains `thresholds`, `housing_shares`, `rent_indices`,
`national_status`, `housing_share_status`, `geography_status`,
`geography_by_area`, `median_diagnostics`, `ce_window` and `acs_window`, plus
national and housing-share source IDs. `thresholds` and `housing_shares` are
keyed by the three named tenures. `rent_indices`, `geography_by_area` and
`median_diagnostics` are keyed by area ID.

The area metadata's `official_published_area` flag identifies its official
anchor status, not whether every target-year amount is published. Inspect
`status`, `anchor_status`, source IDs and support diagnostics. An entry-wide
`geography_status="mixed"` must not be shown as the selected area's status.
County mapping records describe assignments separately; county is never the
estimation unit. See [geography](api/geography.md).

## Integrity and information dates

The content digest is SHA-256 of UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys, compact separators,
unescaped non-ASCII text and no nonfinite numbers, excluding `content_sha256`
itself. File-byte hashes differ because indentation and the embedded digest
change the serialized bytes. Retain a reviewed content digest independently
and pass it to `load_forecast(expected_sha256=...)` on replay.

Accessors return detached values; the verified forecast remains immutable.
An `as_of` earlier than `information_date` fails. The retained-source dates do
not reconstruct a historical real-time information set. Hashes establish
integrity against an expectation, not source authenticity or signed admission.
A provenance-only source refresh changes the artifact and bound runtime bundle
identities even if all amounts remain equal.

## Current artifact identity

Version 1.0.0 uses these pins:

| Identity | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical content (`expected_sha256` / `forecast_content_sha256`) | `3d86d5c4c0423480e6b69b75d222ffa4a7a2639e4094df5ba2504af01be17173` |
| Canonical file bytes | `cc06784feb81f8c7935d4494cea0a9821a79af868ac50383da8be37c6dc14b99` |
| Assumptions | `d81cf3b1a131fb386941e2e5c30792545f7dc965f6ba4c4dfb13e8ca95a3992d` |

The [current canonical download](../web/public/data/canonical/rolling-forecast-cc06784feb81f8c7935d4494cea0a9821a79af868ac50383da8be37c6dc14b99.json)
has the file-byte digest above. These pins describe the published 1.0.0
distribution and this source checkout; each downstream bundle declares its
own coordinated pins.

The September 9, 2026 Python AST portability adaptation changes source and
artifact identities while preserving all scientific values. The
[adaptation receipt](../spm_calculator/data/current/acs_code_identity_adaptation.json)
links the original and current source bytes, unchanged normalization-function
bytes and cache identities, and the
[retained original evidence](../spm_calculator/data/provenance/ast-portability-2026-09-09/README.md).
The earlier normalization receipt still records its original 616,858-record
reparse. This adaptation performs no new raw-source parse or CE/ACS component
calculation.

The current
[equivalence receipt](../spm_calculator/data/current/scientific_refresh_receipt.json)
links that operation to the reassembled artifact and records new exact
comparisons against the
[original immutable download](../web/public/data/canonical/rolling-forecast-76ab8435f087f167ad01b8495ebd016415ba8086f32bfbd3dab961dcc8976c0a.json).
Historical normalization, scientific-refresh and acceptance evidence retain
their original identities and meaning. Downstream bundles must explicitly
adopt the new content digest even though every scientific scenario and
calculation value is unchanged.

The active browser inputs are
[`web/public/data/release_config.json`](../web/public/data/release_config.json).
Their `forecast.auditArtifact` identifies the current immutable canonical
download by file SHA-256. Historical content-addressed downloads remain
available; obsolete `/data/current/` routes are absent.

Verify the adaptation, lightweight assembly and export without raw microdata:

```sh
python scripts/adapt_acs_code_identity.py --check
python scripts/build_rolling_forecast.py --check
python scripts/adapt_acs_code_identity.py --finalize --check
python scripts/export_web_release.py --check
```

## Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| SPM calculator | Published lookup, CE/ACS estimation, assumptions, artifact validation, equivalence and measurement amounts. |
| PolicyEngine | Native membership and measurement roles, tax/benefit/resource formulas, simulation-specific forecast configuration and storage casts. |
| Microcosm Frame | Declared entity links, typed weights, immutable provenance and native population accounting. |
| Axiom core | Native primitive classification and related unit counts, dated parameter/scale lookups, threshold/housing/poverty arithmetic and execution receipts. |

The Axiom adapter exports a bounded canonical equivalence table because the
runtime lacks fractional power. It does not receive final thresholds or
geographic/equivalence factors as per-unit facts. See
[actual Axiom execution and numeric limits](axiom-integration.md). None of these
adapters supplies population certification or turns conditional forecasts into
published statistics.

## Archived inputs and experiments

The sealed schema-1 file
[`spm-2026-09-08.json`](../spm_calculator/data/releases/spm-2026-09-08.json)
and `SPMRelease` reader remain for archived input replay. That artifact contains
its original carried-share/geography assumptions and content identity. It is
not the current CLI, country/provider, Frame or Axiom runtime selection path.
Preserving it does not reinstate removed calculator or projection APIs.

The [2026 correction record](bls-2026-correction.md) preserves publication
vintages, historical replication results and the frozen 2025 forecast.
The [September 8 CE experiment](current-ce-replication.md) records a separate
retrospective exercise. Their committed amounts and commitments are not
rewritten by the current rolling forecast or documentation updates.

## Replay and verify

```sh
python -m spm_calculator.cli verify
python -m spm_calculator.cli calculate --year 2025 --adults 2 --children 2 --tenure renter --national
python -m spm_calculator.cli --scenario zero_real export --format csv
```

`--forecast`, `--expect-sha256`, `--as-of` and `--scenario` are global options
placed before the subcommand. The [quickstart](quickstart.md) demonstrates a
file/digest round trip. [Validation](validation.md) separates artifact checks
from scientific source verification and optional real-runtime acceptance.
