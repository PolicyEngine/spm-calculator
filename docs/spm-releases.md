# Forecast artifacts and archived releases

Version 1.1.0 uses the canonical schema-2 forecast artifact for standalone
calculations and current model adapters. Its default coverage is 2022–2036,
with `ce_trend` and `zero_real` scenarios. Published 2025 national thresholds
and BLS shelter/utilities shares remain exact inputs; modeled local rent
indices and future values carry their own statuses.

The PolicyEngine, Microcosm and Axiom adapters ship inside this package; the
PolicyEngine country and wrapper integration ships in `policyengine-us` 2.0
and the `policyengine` wrapper 6.0, both in progress, and the
[1.0 migration guide](migration.md) describes the coordinated pins. In that
integration the country model reads forecast configuration by default. It does
not require an opt-in historical release path or support year/geography
fallback flags.

## Schema-2 forecast contract

The default file is
[`rolling_forecast_2026_09_09.json`](../spm_calculator/data/current/rolling_forecast_2026_09_09.json).
`SPMForecast.from_dict` and `load_forecast` validate it. The archived
`data/releases/schema-v1.json` describes schema-1 releases, not this schema-2
forecast; the forecast's current validator is
[`rolling_forecast.py`](../spm_calculator/rolling_forecast.py).

| Field or path | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Integer `2`. |
| `method` | `rolling_ce_acs_v1`. |
| `units` | `USD/year`. |
| `reference_family` | `{"adults": 2, "children": 2}`. |
| `forecast_id`, `content_sha256` | Artifact identity and canonical content digest. |
| `created_on`, `information_date` | Build and retained-information dates. |
| `base_release_sha256` | Identity of the archived published input release used by assembly. |
| `sources` | List of source IDs, URLs, hashes and availability metadata. |
| `assumptions`, `assumption_sha256` | Declared assumptions and their digest. |
| `component_sha256`, `code_sha256` | Component and implementation identities. |
| `default_scenario` | Currently `ce_trend`. |
| `scenarios.<scenario>.years.<year>` | Selected-year values, statuses and window diagnostics; JSON year keys are strings. |
| `areas.<area_id>` | Area name and actual area type. |
| `county_assignments` | County vintage, boundary metadata, mapping digest, `year_maps` and `maps`. |
| `validation`, `forward_test`, `rent_sensitivity` | Evaluation and sensitivity records with their stated scope. |

Inspect these actual field names rather than constructing an incomplete
artifact by hand:

```python
from spm_calculator import load_forecast

forecast = load_forecast()
document = forecast.to_dict()
assert document["schema_version"] == 2
assert document["units"] == "USD/year"
assert document["reference_family"] == {"adults": 2, "children": 2}
entry = document["scenarios"]["ce_trend"]["years"]["2025"]
print(entry["national_status"], entry["housing_share_status"])
print(entry["thresholds"]["renter"], entry["housing_shares"]["renter"])
assignment = forecast.resolve_county(2025, "06037", county_vintage="2020")
print(entry["geography_by_area"][assignment["area_id"]])
```

Each year entry contains `thresholds`, `housing_shares`, `rent_indices`,
`national_status`, `housing_share_status`, `geography_status`,
`geography_by_area`, `median_diagnostics`, `ce_window` and `acs_window`, plus
national and housing-share source IDs. `thresholds` and `housing_shares` are
keyed by the three named tenures. `rent_indices`, `geography_by_area` and
`median_diagnostics` are keyed by area ID.

The area metadata's `official_published_area` flag identifies its official
anchor status, not whether every target-year amount is published. Inspect
`status`, `anchor_status`, source IDs and support diagnostics. An entry-wide
`geography_status="mixed"` must not be shown as the selected area's status.
County mapping records describe assignments separately; county is never the
estimation unit. See [geography](api/geography.md).

## Integrity and information dates

The content digest is SHA-256 of UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys, compact separators,
unescaped non-ASCII text and no nonfinite numbers, excluding `content_sha256`
itself. File-byte hashes differ because indentation and the embedded digest
change the serialized bytes. Retain a reviewed content digest independently
and pass it to `load_forecast(expected_sha256=...)` on replay.

Accessors return detached values; the verified forecast remains immutable.
An `as_of` earlier than `information_date` fails. The retained-source dates do
not reconstruct a historical real-time information set. Hashes establish
integrity against an expectation, not source authenticity or signed admission.
A provenance-only source refresh changes the artifact and bound runtime bundle
identities even if all amounts remain equal.

## Current artifact identity

Version 1.1.0 uses these pins:

| Identity | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical content (`expected_sha256` / `forecast_content_sha256`) | `335e6755dc8e0bd883e09b76c2bd53a5315683773e44d50085c7d6b8832b6291` |
| Canonical file bytes | `53d2b4b32251d3afbcf62a76c0f843c2a9369b3565acf088d6729b3bd8069d1b` |
| Assumptions | `6ef10c97d39a95720cce7993036b3db702b9f7c8c71a1e1ec37c104d85f18dfd` |

The [current canonical download](../web/public/data/canonical/rolling-forecast-53d2b4b32251d3afbcf62a76c0f843c2a9369b3565acf088d6729b3bd8069d1b.json)
has the file-byte digest above. Each downstream bundle declares its own
coordinated pins.

Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.1 cover 2022–2035 with content
`3d86d5c4c0423480e6b69b75d222ffa4a7a2639e4094df5ba2504af01be17173`, file bytes
`cc06784feb81f8c7935d4494cea0a9821a79af868ac50383da8be37c6dc14b99` and
assumptions `d81cf3b1a131fb386941e2e5c30792545f7dc965f6ba4c4dfb13e8ca95a3992d`.
That artifact remains available as an
[immutable download](../web/public/data/canonical/rolling-forecast-cc06784feb81f8c7935d4494cea0a9821a79af868ac50383da8be37c6dc14b99.json).

Version 1.1.0 extends the horizon to 2036. The CE and ACS components are
rebuilt from cached raw inputs and the forecast is reassembled. The
[horizon receipt](../spm_calculator/data/current/scientific_refresh_receipt.json)
records exact comparisons against the 1.0.x artifact. Every 2022–2035 field
and all 2,110,752 retained calculations are unchanged. Only these differ:
- the 2036 entries;
- the extended code identities;
- the rebuilt components;
- the seals;
- the relative-index stabilization disclosure, which now runs through 2036;
- the September 9 adaptation link, which a fresh ACS build does not repeat.

The receipt also runs 150,768 calculations for 2036. It records two things
the rebuild kept from 1.0.x: all 56 source pins (raw caches and packaged
inputs) and the normalized-products manifest (`49b12d77…`). The operator
attests the rest in
[the release pull request](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/spm-calculator/pull/51):
the commands, each builder's `--check` result, and whether the ACS build
reused the retained normalized products or reparsed raw PUMS.
The
[extension archive](../spm_calculator/data/provenance/horizon-2036-extension/README.md)
keeps the replaced component bytes and the previous receipt.

### Rebuilding for a new horizon

The component builders read raw microdata from external caches: CE PUMD
under `~/.cache/spm-calculator/ce-pumd` and ACS PUMS under
`~/.cache/spm-calculator/acs-pums`, or the path given with `--cache-dir`.
Each builder checks every raw file against its pin. Use the `uv.lock`
environment (`uv sync --frozen`) on Python 3.12 or 3.13: the CE builder
reproduces the committed bytes under those versions but not under 3.11. The
1.1.0 rebuild used Python 3.13. On Windows, check the repository out with
`core.autocrlf=false`, because the pins are of LF bytes. Run the builders in
this order. Each later step pins the outputs of the earlier ones.

```sh
python scripts/build_forecast_inputs.py
python scripts/build_acs_2021_inputs.py --cache-dir <acs-pums cache>
python scripts/build_ce_forecast.py --cache-dir <ce-pumd cache> --output spm_calculator/data/current/ce_rolling_forecast.json
python scripts/build_acs_forecast.py --cache-dir <acs-pums cache> --output spm_calculator/data/current/acs_rolling_forecast.json
python scripts/build_rolling_forecast.py
python scripts/verify_horizon_extension.py --output spm_calculator/data/current/scientific_refresh_receipt.json
```

Each builder's `--check` form repeats its step and fails if the committed
output differs. `build_forecast_inputs.py` and `build_rolling_forecast.py`
need no raw data. `build_acs_2021_inputs.py` comes before the ACS forecast,
because the 2021 bundle pins the county-assignment digest. Skipping it fails
with "Historical county assignment changed". The scientific checks in full:

```sh
python scripts/build_acs_2021_inputs.py --cache-dir <acs-pums cache> --check
python scripts/build_ce_forecast.py --cache-dir <ce-pumd cache> --output spm_calculator/data/current/ce_rolling_forecast.json --check
python scripts/build_acs_forecast.py --cache-dir <acs-pums cache> --output spm_calculator/data/current/acs_rolling_forecast.json --check
```

**Filling the caches.** Each component's `sources` say what the caches must
hold:
- The CE component lists the 11 interview bundles (`intrvw14.zip` to
  `intrvw24.zip`), with the hash of each member file.
- The ACS component gives each PUMS file's `url` and `cache_path`.

bls.gov blocks scripted downloads of the CE bundles. The ACS PUMS files are
about 4.3 GB. The ACS loader reuses `normalized/<vintage>-<fingerprint>.npz`
and its receipt when both are in the cache. Without them it reparses raw
PUMS. The operator record for 1.1.0 states which path its build took.

**Moving the horizon again.**
- The end year appears in several places:
  - `projection_rates` in `spm_calculator/forecast_inputs.py`;
  - `build_ce_forecast` in `spm_calculator/ce_forecast.py`;
  - `end_spm_year` and the PUMA-vintage range in `scripts/build_acs_forecast.py`;
  - the year ranges in `scripts/build_forecast_inputs.py` and `scripts/build_rolling_forecast.py`;
  - the probes in `scripts/validate_axiom_integration.py`.
- `scripts/verify_horizon_extension.py` pins `ADDED_YEAR`, `RETAINED_YEARS`, the baseline download and the files a rebuild replaces. A new extension needs its own pins and provenance archive.
- 2036 is the last year of CBO's February 2026 file. A 2037 horizon needs a newer CBO vintage, and that vintage also changes the 2026–2036 rates.

The September 9, 2026 Python AST portability adaptation changed source and
artifact identities while preserving all scientific values. The
[adaptation receipt](../spm_calculator/data/current/acs_code_identity_adaptation.json)
links the original and adapted source bytes, unchanged normalization-function
bytes and cache identities, and the
[retained original evidence](../spm_calculator/data/provenance/ast-portability-2026-09-09/README.md).
The earlier normalization receipt still records its original 616,858-record
reparse. The 1.1.0 rebuild replaces the adapted ACS component. Tests now read
the adapted bytes from the extension archive, and `adapt_acs_code_identity.py`
no longer reproduces current files. Its
[original immutable download](../web/public/data/canonical/rolling-forecast-76ab8435f087f167ad01b8495ebd016415ba8086f32bfbd3dab961dcc8976c0a.json)
remains available. Historical normalization, scientific-refresh and
acceptance evidence retain their original identities and meaning.
Downstream bundles must explicitly adopt the new content digest.

The active browser inputs are
[`web/public/data/release_config.json`](../web/public/data/release_config.json).
Their `forecast.auditArtifact` identifies the current immutable canonical
download by file SHA-256. Historical content-addressed downloads remain
available; obsolete `/data/current/` routes are absent.

Verify the assembly without raw microdata, and repeat the horizon comparison:

```sh
python scripts/build_rolling_forecast.py --check
python scripts/verify_horizon_extension.py --check
```

`verify_horizon_extension.py --check` runs the full calculation grid and fails
unless the committed receipt equals a fresh one. Without `--check` or
`--output` it prints the receipt; `--no-calculate` skips the grid.

The committed browser export identifies the verified PyPI package 1.1.0.
Reproduce and verify the export with:

```sh
python scripts/export_web_release.py --published-package-version 1.1.0
python scripts/export_web_release.py --published-package-version 1.1.0 --check
```

The exporter requires the publication flag to match `pyproject.toml`. Omit the
flag when generating and checking an unpublished preview export, whose default
status is `local_preview`. Package publication and browser promotion happen
separately; the live app retains its verified package pin until promotion.

## Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| SPM calculator | Published lookup, CE/ACS estimation, assumptions, artifact validation, equivalence and measurement amounts. |
| PolicyEngine | Native membership and measurement roles, tax/benefit/resource formulas, simulation-specific forecast configuration and storage casts. |
| Microcosm Frame | Declared entity links, typed weights, immutable provenance and native population accounting. |
| Axiom core | Native primitive classification and related unit counts, dated parameter/scale lookups, threshold/housing/poverty arithmetic and execution receipts. |

The Axiom adapter exports a bounded canonical equivalence table because the
runtime lacks fractional power. It does not receive final thresholds or
geographic/equivalence factors as per-unit facts. See
[actual Axiom execution and numeric limits](axiom-integration.md). None of these
adapters supplies population certification or turns conditional forecasts into
published statistics.

## Archived inputs and experiments

The sealed schema-1 file
[`spm-2026-09-08.json`](../spm_calculator/data/releases/spm-2026-09-08.json)
and `SPMRelease` reader remain for archived input replay. That artifact contains
its original carried-share/geography assumptions and content identity. It is
not the current CLI, country/provider, Frame or Axiom runtime selection path.
Preserving it does not reinstate removed calculator or projection APIs.

The [2026 correction record](bls-2026-correction.md) preserves publication
vintages, historical replication results and the frozen 2025 forecast.
The [September 8 CE experiment](current-ce-replication.md) records a separate
retrospective exercise. Their committed amounts and commitments are not
rewritten by the current rolling forecast or documentation updates.

## Replay and verify

```sh
python -m spm_calculator.cli verify
python -m spm_calculator.cli calculate --year 2025 --adults 2 --children 2 --tenure renter --national
python -m spm_calculator.cli --scenario zero_real export --format csv
```

`--forecast`, `--expect-sha256`, `--as-of` and `--scenario` are global options
placed before the subcommand. The [quickstart](quickstart.md) demonstrates a
file/digest round trip. [Validation](validation.md) separates artifact checks
from scientific source verification and optional real-runtime acceptance.
