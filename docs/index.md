# SPM calculator

Use version 1.0.0 to calculate Supplemental Poverty Measure thresholds from
published 2025 national values and tenure housing shares, or conditional
CE/ACS rolling forecasts through 2035. Standalone calculations read bundled,
verified inputs offline.

Install with `pip install spm-calculator==1.0.0` or
`uv add spm-calculator==1.0.0` from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spm-calculator/1.0.0/). The calculator also runs in the browser at
[policyengine.org/us/spm-calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/spm-calculator), and the companion paper
is at [spm-threshold-paper.vercel.app](https://spm-threshold-paper.vercel.app/).

Start with the [quickstart](quickstart.md) for Python and CLI examples. The
[API reference](api.md) describes `SPMForecast`, `SPMUnit`, year-specific area
assignment and source metadata. The default artifact covers 2022–2035;
unknown years and locations fail instead of triggering a runtime projection.

A county identifies an assignment to an SPM estimation area for the selected
year. National is an explicit choice. Local amounts can use modeled rent
indices even when national thresholds are published; inspect each component's
status and the area's diagnostics.

Read [validation](validation.md) alongside [rolling forecasts](rolling-forecasts.md)
for the source checks, conditional assumptions and unresolved uncertainty.
[Historical correction and experiment records](bls-2026-correction.md) remain
separate from current runtime examples.
